# Exercises in the project
in the project we only concluded 3 exercises:
pushups, squats and Bench Press Dips.

# How the project works

We used the following libraries:
- opencv
- mediapipe
- flask - for gui

We measured the angles of human parts using mediapipe and according to that we can know if the the person doing the exersice correctly.
repetetions also calculated accorfing to the form wich known by the mesaured angles.
